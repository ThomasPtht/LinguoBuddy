# Lingobuddy

App for learning english by creating collections of words and sentences/expressions. The user can add words/idioms/expressions and put them in a context by writing sentences with them. The user can then review the collections by using flashcards.

LanguageTool API is used to check the sentences made by the user and alert him if there are any grammar mistakes.

## Technologies Used

- Angular 21
- NestJS
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
- SCSS
- Docker

## Known Issues

- P1000 Authentication Error on prisma migrate dev
  Solution : Native PostgreSQL on Windows using port 5432. Change the port to 5433 in the docker-compose.yml and in the .env file.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
